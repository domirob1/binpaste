## Description
A minimal [pastebin](http://pastebin.com) knockoff.

## Details for teaching team
I've implemented a really simple pastebin knockoff.  It allows you to
create an account, login/logout, and has the basic CRUD operations on
snippets ("pastes") of plaintext.  The pastes can be flagged private or
public, and no account is required to see the public pastes.

As far as Laravel features, I've used seeding (with faker) and validation,
but didn't get to the unit tests.
